<p class="font">I chose <a href="http://justacarguy.blogspot.com/">http://justacarguy.blogspot.com/</a> as a website to admire. What makes this a good website is the styling. The content for a car website doesnt really matter, as long as there are a lot of car pictures, which there are. The text is off to the side and small, showing that the creator knew that nothing else was important but the cars. this is a blog website so that is pretty obvious, but the layout is also what made blogspot so popular, and worth so much.</p>
